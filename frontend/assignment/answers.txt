1.How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?
- Using context API which works as a global state management
- Context API reduces the problem of passing props to every component individually every time by creating a global state
which is accessed easily whenever needed
- We can share state across components without props at any level
- e.g. dark theme, ecommerce cart count, etc...

2.Why is the useState hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?
- useState manages the state of a component
- used when we need dynamic data which is more of component specific
- e.g. cart item count, api data storing state, etc...
